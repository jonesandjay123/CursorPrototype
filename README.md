Hi Vasudha & Team,

Thanks for providing the initial information and suggestions regarding "Agentic RAG." After some research and discussion, I’d like to share a clearer summary and potential practical next steps for us:

1. What is Agentic RAG?

Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) is a more advanced concept compared to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs).

Traditional LLMs typically rely on pre-trained static knowledge to answer questions, which can lead to outdated or inaccurate information, often referred to as "hallucinations."

Agentic RAG allows LLMs to autonomously decide whether additional information is required and actively retrieve (RAG) relevant and up-to-date data to verify and enhance their responses.

In short, Agentic RAG enables LLMs to engage in self-directed decision-making and multi-step information retrieval, rather than just generating responses based on static knowledge.

Comparison: Minion Assistant vs. Agentic RAG

Upon reviewing our existing Minion Assistant framework, I found that it already aligns with many core principles of Agentic RAG:

Minion Assistant leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and API integrations to allow users to query various databases (e.g., Athena, RDS) using natural language.

It already incorporates LLMs to improve the readability and usability of retrieved data.

However, Minion Assistant currently lacks the autonomous decision-making and multi-step retrieval capabilities emphasized by Agentic RAG. This means that our LLM does not yet proactively determine when deeper data retrieval is required or conduct iterative searches.

Thus, while Minion Assistant represents an initial step toward Agentic RAG, it has not yet fully realized its potential.

Proposed Improvements & Practical Next Steps

To quickly validate and implement Agentic RAG capabilities, I recommend the following steps:

Leverage Existing Infrastructure Without Major Overhaul

We can continue using the current Minion Assistant API and database structure without significant architectural changes.

Introduce a Lightweight LLM Agent Framework (e.g., LangChain)

LangChain is a well-established open-source framework designed for developing LLM applications with autonomous decision-making.

Integrating LangChain would introduce an "intelligent agent layer" that enables our LLM to plan and determine when additional data retrieval is necessary, supporting multi-step queries.

POC (Proof of Concept) Implementation Plan

Step 1: Ensure that Minion API returns structured data in JSON or other usable formats.

Step 2: Develop a small-scale LangChain Agent that translates user queries into API calls and includes:

Autonomous evaluation of whether additional data is required.

Multi-step retrieval planning, where insufficient query results trigger refined or additional searches.

Step 3: Conduct internal testing to evaluate response accuracy with the new retrieval logic.

Conclusion

I believe that we do not need to build a completely new system from scratch. Instead, we can conduct a lightweight enhancement of the existing Minion framework to validate the Agentic RAG concept. This approach allows us to efficiently test the feasibility of this methodology while minimizing resource expenditure.

My recommendation is to focus our next steps on exploring LangChain as an open-source framework to enhance LLM-driven autonomous decision-making, making Minion Assistant more aligned with modern Agentic RAG architectures.

I look forward to hearing the team's thoughts and feedback.

Regards
